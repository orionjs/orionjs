## Creating a new component

```
exampleComponent/
├── controllers/      # Controllers for different aspects of the component
│   ├── echoes/       # Event listeners
│   ├── routes/         # HTTP routes
│   ├── jobs/         # Background jobs
│   ├── modelResolvers/ # GraphQL model resolvers
│   └── resolvers/    # GraphQL resolvers
├── repos/            # Data repositories
├── schemas/          # Data schemas/models
├── services/         # Business logic services
└── index.ts          # Component definition with the controllers, repos, schemas and services
└── Component.md      # A markdown file that describes the component for later use by other Agent
```

Each component controller type folder has an index.ts (for example controllers/resolvers/index.ts) that exports default an array (which will be filled with the Classes) like this:

```ts
export default []
```

The component definition index.ts is always like this:

```ts
import {component} from '@orion-js/components'
import resolvers from './controllers/resolvers'
import routes from './controllers/routes'
import jobs from './controllers/jobs'
import echoes from './controllers/echoes'
import modelResolvers from './controllers/modelResolvers'

export default component({
  resolvers,
  routes,
  jobs,
  echoes,
  modelResolvers,
})
```

### Controllers

- Controllers are the entry points for code execution.
- Keep controllers thin - they should only:
  - Handle input validation
  - Call the appropriate services
  - Transform and return the response
- Different types of controllers:
  - Route controllers: Handle HTTP endpoints
  - GraphQL resolvers: Handle GraphQL operations
  - Job controllers: Handle scheduled or on-demand tasks
  - Echo controllers: Handle event-based communication
- GraphQL resolvers are the prefered over routes for exposing method to the client

### Component.md

You should after each task update the Component.md file with the new information.
If there is no Component.md file, you should create it, read the whole component folder and write the information in the Component.md file.
You should always read the Component.md file before starting a new task.
