## Creating a new component

```
exampleComponent/
├── controllers/      # Controllers for different aspects of the component
│   ├── echoes/       # Event listeners
│   ├── routes/         # HTTP routes
│   ├── jobs/         # Background jobs
│   ├── modelResolvers/ # GraphQL model resolvers
│   └── resolvers/    # GraphQL resolvers container folder
│       ├── users/    # User-related resolvers
│       ├── orders/   # Order-related resolvers
│       └── products/ # Product-related resolvers
│       └── index.ts  # Exports all the resolvers in all subfolders as a single array
├── repos/            # Data repositories
├── schemas/          # Data schemas/models
├── services/         # Business logic services
└── index.ts          # Component definition with the controllers, repos, schemas and services
└── Component.md      # A markdown with notes for later use by other Agents
```

Each component controller type folder has an index.ts (for example controllers/resolvers/index.ts) that exports default an array (which will be filled with the Classes) like this:

```ts
export default []
```

Important note: The `resolvers/` sub-folder is a new requirement, so if you don't see that pattern you should update the resolvers folder to use it.

The component definition index.ts is always like this:

```ts
import {component} from '@orion-js/components'
import resolvers from './controllers/resolvers'
import routes from './controllers/routes'
import jobs from './controllers/jobs'
import echoes from './controllers/echoes'
import modelResolvers from './controllers/modelResolvers'

export default component({
  resolvers,
  routes,
  jobs,
  echoes,
  modelResolvers,
})
```

### Controllers

- Controllers are the entry points for code execution.
- Keep controllers thin - they should only:
  - Handle input validation
  - Call the appropriate services
  - Transform and return the response
- Different types of controllers:
  - Route controllers: Handle HTTP endpoints
  - GraphQL resolvers: Handle GraphQL operations
  - Job controllers: Handle scheduled or on-demand tasks
  - Echo controllers: Handle event-based communication
- GraphQL resolvers are the prefered over routes for exposing method to the client

## CRITICAL: Component.md Management

**Component.md serves as a memory store for agents** - it contains essential notes that help future agents understand the component without having to read all the code.

**Structure:**
Component.md should contain organized "notes" as bullet points, where each note is 2-5 phrases describing:
- Key business logic and data flows
- Important architectural decisions 
- External dependencies and integrations
- Critical implementation details
- Known issues or limitations
- How to check for permissions
- Anything else that is important to know about the component

**MANDATORY ACTIONS:**
- BEFORE any task: Read the Component.md file if it exists
- IF no Component.md exists: IMMEDIATELY create it by reading the whole component folder
- AFTER any schema, service, or controller changes: Update the Component.md with relevant notes
- AFTER adding new features: Document important implementation details in Component.md

**What to include:** Only store notes that would be valuable for the next agent to understand the component's purpose, behavior, and important implementation details.

**What NOT to include:** Avoid storing temporary information, detailed code explanations, or information that can be easily derived from reading the code structure.
