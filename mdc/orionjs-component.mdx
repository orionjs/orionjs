## Creating a new component

```
exampleComponent/
├── controllers/      # Controllers for different aspects of the component
│   ├── echoes/       # Event listeners
│   ├── routes/         # HTTP routes
│   ├── jobs/         # Background jobs
│   ├── modelResolvers/ # GraphQL model resolvers
│   └── resolvers/    # GraphQL resolvers
├── repos/            # Data repositories
├── schemas/          # Data schemas/models
├── services/         # Business logic services
└── index.ts          # Component definition with the controllers, repos, schemas and services
```

Each component controller type folder has an index.ts (for example controllers/resolvers/index.ts) that exports default an array (which will be filled with the Classes) like this:

```ts
export default []
```

The component definition index.ts is always like this:

```ts
import {component} from '@orion-js/components'
import resolvers from './controllers/resolvers'
import routes from './controllers/routes'
import jobs from './controllers/jobs'
import echoes from './controllers/echoes'
import modelResolvers from './controllers/modelResolvers'

export default component({
  resolvers,
  routes,
  jobs,
  echoes,
  modelResolvers,
})
```

### Controllers

- Controllers are the entry points for code execution.
- Keep controllers thin - they should only:
  - Handle input validation
  - Call the appropriate services
  - Transform and return the response
- Different types of controllers:
  - Route controllers: Handle HTTP endpoints
  - GraphQL resolvers: Handle GraphQL operations
  - Job controllers: Handle scheduled or on-demand tasks
  - Echo controllers: Handle event-based communication
- GraphQL resolvers are the prefered over routes for exposing method to the client
