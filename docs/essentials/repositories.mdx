Repositories in Orionjs are specialized services that handle data access operations. They follow the repository pattern, which separates data access logic from business logic, making your code more maintainable and testable.

## Basic Usage

Repositories use the `@Repository` decorator, which is a semantic distinction from `@Service` to clarify the component's purpose:

```typescript
import {Repository} from '@orion-js/mongodb'

@Repository()
export class UserRepository {
  // Methods for data access operations
  async findById(id: string) {
    // Implementation...
    return user
  }

  async create(userData) {
    // Implementation...
    return newUser
  }
}
```

## Why Use Repositories?

While repositories are functionally similar to services (both use dependency injection), they serve different purposes:

- **Services** handle business logic, orchestration, and use cases
- **Repositories** focus exclusively on data access and persistence

This separation of concerns leads to:
- Cleaner code organization
- Easier testing
- Better maintainability
- Clearer dependencies

## Dependency Injection

Like services, repositories can be injected into other components:

```typescript
import {Service, Inject} from '@orion-js/services'
import {UserRepository} from './UserRepository'

@Service()
export class UserService {
  @Inject()
  private userRepository: UserRepository

  async validateAndCreateUser(userData) {
    // Business logic and validation here
    
    // Use repository for data operations
    return this.userRepository.create(userData)
  }
}
```
