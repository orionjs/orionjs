Orionjs provides a flexible system for configuring and managing MongoDB connections. This allows you to connect to multiple MongoDB instances or databases as needed.

## Default Connection

By default, Orionjs will look for a MongoDB connection string in the `MONGO_URL` or `env.mongo_url` environment variable. This is the simplest way to get started:

```typescript
// In your environment configuration
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/my-database
```

You don't need any additional code to use the default connection - all collections will use it automatically unless specified otherwise.
