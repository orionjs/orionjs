---

Orionjs is a NodeJS framework designed with simplicity in mind. It consists primarily of controllers, which initiate operations within your application, and services, which handle the core logic.

Orionjs was born with the vision of being a NodeJS framework that is focused on looking for simplicity when developing and being friendly for the developer.

The framework is actively used at scale and maintained by [Justo](https://getjusto.com) in Chile.
