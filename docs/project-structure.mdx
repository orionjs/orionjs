An Orionjs application follows a modular, component-based architecture that promotes clean organization and separation of concerns. Below is the typical structure of an Orionjs project based on our example application.

## Root Directory

```
/
├── app/              # Main application code
├── node_modules/     # Project dependencies
├── .env.local.yml    # Environment variables for local development
├── .gitignore        # Git ignore file
├── biome.json        # Biome configuration (for linting/formatting)
├── package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
└── yarn.lock         # Yarn dependency lock file
```

## App Directory

The `app` directory contains all the application code:

```
app/
├── config/           # Application configuration
├── components/       # Application components (in our example: exampleComponent)
├── env.d.ts          # Environment type definitions
└── index.ts          # Application entry point
```

## Component Structure

Each component follows a consistent structure:

```
exampleComponent/
├── controllers/      # Controllers for different aspects of the component
│   ├── echoes/       # Event listeners
│   ├── http/         # HTTP routes
│   ├── jobs/         # Background jobs
│   ├── modelResolvers/ # GraphQL model resolvers
│   └── resolvers/    # GraphQL resolvers
├── repos/            # Data repositories
├── schemas/          # Data schemas/models
├── services/         # Business logic services
└── index.ts          # Component definition and exports
```

## Configuration Structure

The `config` directory contains application-wide configuration:

```
config/
├── echoes/           # Event system configuration
├── graphql/          # GraphQL server configuration
├── health/           # Health check endpoints
├── http/             # HTTP server configuration
├── jobs/             # Background job configuration
├── options/          # Application options/settings
└── index.ts          # Configuration entry point
```

## Application Bootstrap

The application is bootstrapped in `app/index.ts`, where components are registered:

```typescript
import {startApp} from './config'
import exampleComponent from './exampleComponent'

startApp([exampleComponent])
```

## Component Definition

Components are defined using the `component` function:

```typescript
import {component} from '@orion-js/components'
import echoes from './controllers/echoes'
import routes from './controllers/http'
import jobs from './controllers/jobs'
import modelResolvers from './controllers/modelResolvers'
import resolvers from './controllers/resolvers'

export default component({
  echoes,
  routes,
  jobs,
  modelResolvers,
  resolvers,
})
```

This modular approach allows you to organize your application by domains or features, making it easier to maintain and extend your codebase.
