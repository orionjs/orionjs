Orionjs is a NodeJS framework designed with simplicity in mind. It consists primarily of controllers, which initiate operations within your application, and services, which handle the core logic.

We are developing Orionjs to be optimized for seamless AI-generated code.

Orionjs was born with the vision of being a NodeJS framework that is focused on looking for simplicity when developing and being friendly for the developer.

The framework is actively used at scale and maintained by [Justo](https://getjusto.com) in Chile.

## Core Concepts

Orionjs is built around several key concepts that work together to create a clean, maintainable architecture:

### Controllers
Controllers are the starting point of all code executions. Orionjs supports multiple types of controllers:
- **HTTP controllers**: Handle HTTP requests
- **GraphQL controllers**: Handle GraphQL requests (queries, mutations, subscriptions, and model resolvers)
- **Jobs controllers**: Execute scheduled or queued jobs
- **Echoes controllers**: Facilitate communication between services

### Repositories
Repositories serve as the data access layer. They are responsible for fetching data from databases or other external sources, keeping your data access logic separate from business logic.

### Services
Services contain the business logic of your application. Controllers invoke functions in services, which implement the core functionality of your application.

### Schemas
Schemas define your data models. They enable code reusability by providing a way to validate data, create database models, generate GraphQL schemas, and define TypeScript interfaces.

### Components
Components are the building blocks of your application. An app can have many components, each containing its own controllers, repositories, services, and schemas.
