---

This guide will help you set up a new Orionjs project quickly by using our example repository.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- [tsx](https://tsx.is/) installed in your project
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local instance or connection string)
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and Node.js

## Using the Example Project

The fastest way to get started with Orionjs is to use our example project. It provides a fully functioning application that demonstrates the core features and best practices.

```bash
# Clone the entire Orionjs repository
git clone https://github.com/orionjs/orionjs-services-starter

# Navigate to the example directory
cd orionjs-services-starter

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

## Project Structure

The example project follows the standard Orionjs structure:

```
example/
├── app/                # Main application code
│   ├── config/         # Application configuration
│   ├── exampleComponent/ # Example component implementation
│   ├── env.d.ts        # Environment type definitions
│   └── index.ts        # Application entry point
├── .env.local.yml      # Environment variables
├── package.json        # Project dependencies
├── start.sh            # Start script for local development
└── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
```

For a more detailed explanation of the project structure, check out our [Project Structure](/overview/project-structure) guide.

## Running the Application

Before running the application, make sure you have MongoDB running. The example project is configured to connect to `mongodb://localhost:3003/example` by default.

You can start the application in development mode using:

```bash
# Using the provided start script
./start.sh

# Or manually
export ORION_ENV_SECRET_KEY=pk+uJ3wTEZxuDWKF6zdeypUzQQNkKE3i+bnfHe6g+RU=
export ORION_ENV_FILE_PATH=.env.local.yml
export PORT=3010
pnpm orion dev
```

The application will start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3010`.

## Key Features of the Example

The example project demonstrates several key features of Orionjs:

- Component-based architecture
- Configuration management
- Environment variable handling
- TypeScript integration
- Project structure best practices

## Learning from the Example

We recommend exploring the example code to understand:

1. How components are organized and structured
2. Configuration patterns for different environments
3. The integration between different Orionjs modules
4. How to set up and manage environment variables securely

## Customizing the Example

After getting the example running, you can start customizing it:

1. Create your own components following the same structure
2. Add or modify HTTP controllers for REST endpoints
3. Implement GraphQL resolvers and models
4. Set up background jobs or event-driven features with Echoes
5. Configure database connections for your specific needs

## Next Steps

After exploring the example project, check out our other documentation sections to learn more about specific aspects of Orionjs:

- [Controllers](/overview/controllers/overview)
- [Models and Schemas](/overview/essentials/schemas)
- [Services](/overview/essentials/services)
- [GraphQL](/overview/essentials/graphql)

Happy coding with Orionjs!
