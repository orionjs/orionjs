title: Migrations
---

The migrations module in Orion.js provides a way to perform and track database migrations or any other system changes that need to be executed only once in a sequential manner.

## Installation

First, install the package:

```bash
npm install @orion-js/migrations
# or
yarn add @orion-js/migrations
```

## Basic Concepts

Migrations in Orion.js:

- Run sequentially in the order they are defined
- Execute only once (tracked in the database)
- Can optionally run within MongoDB transactions
- Automatically run through a background job that checks for pending migrations

## Configuration

To set up migrations in your project, you need to:

1. Create migration services
2. Load them in your application

### Setting Up Migrations

Create a configuration file for migrations, typically at `app/config/migrations/index.ts`:

```typescript
import {loadMigrations} from '@orion-js/migrations'
import {MigrationExample1} from './list/MigrationExample1'
import {MigrationExample2} from './list/MigrationExample2'

// Load migrations in the order they should execute
loadMigrations([MigrationExample1, MigrationExample2])
```

### Creating Migration Files

Migrations are defined as services using the `MigrationService` decorator. Each migration must have:

- A unique name (typically including a version number)
- A `runMigration` method containing the migration logic

Example migration file (`app/config/migrations/list/MigrationExample1/index.ts`):

```typescript
import {ExecutionContext} from '@orion-js/dogs'
import {logger} from '@orion-js/logger'
import {MigrationService} from '@orion-js/migrations'

@MigrationService({
  name: 'MigrationExample1.v1',
  useMongoTransactions: false
})
export class MigrationExample1 {
  async runMigration(context: ExecutionContext) {
    // Extend lock time if needed for long-running migrations
    context.extendLockTime(1000 * 60 * 60) // one hour
    
    logger.info('Running migration example 1')
    
    // Implement your migration logic here
    // For example:
    // - Update database records
    // - Create new collections
    // - Transform data
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### MongoDB Transactions

For operations that need to be atomic, you can use MongoDB transactions:

```typescript
@MigrationService({
  name: 'TransactionalMigration.v1',
  useMongoTransactions: true
})
export class TransactionalMigration {
  async runMigration(context: ExecutionContext) {
    // All database operations will be in a transaction
    // If any operation fails, all changes will be rolled back
  }
}
```

### Long-Running Migrations

For migrations that take a long time to complete, extend the lock time to prevent the job from timing out:

```typescript
async runMigration(context: ExecutionContext) {
  // Extend lock time to two hours
  context.extendLockTime(1000 * 60 * 60 * 2)
  
  // Long-running operations...
}
```

### Disabling Automatic Execution

If you want to manually control when migrations run, you can disable the automatic job:

```typescript
loadMigrations([MigrationExample1, MigrationExample2], {
  omitJob: true
})
```

Then you can manually trigger migrations using the `MigrationsService`:

```typescript
import {getInstance} from '@orion-js/services'
import {MigrationsService} from '@orion-js/migrations'
import {createContext} from '@orion-js/dogs'

// To run migrations manually
const migrationService = getInstance(MigrationsService)
const context = createContext()
await migrationService.runMigrations(migrations, context)
```

## How It Works

Migrations in Orion.js work using a background job that:

1. Checks for pending migrations every 30 seconds
2. Runs the next unexecuted migration
3. Marks the migration as complete upon successful execution
4. Continues until all migrations are executed

Migrations are stored in the `orionjs.migrations` collection in MongoDB with their execution status.
