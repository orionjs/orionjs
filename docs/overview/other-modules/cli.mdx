The Orionjs CLI is a command-line tool that helps you develop and build Orionjs applications.

## Installation

The CLI is part of the `@orion-js/core` package. You can install it globally:

```bash
pnpm add -g @orion-js/core --ignore-scripts
```

## Available Commands

Orionjs CLI provides essential commands to help you with your development workflow.

### orion dev

Runs your Orionjs application in development mode with hot reloading.

```bash
orion dev [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--shell`: Opens a shell in Chrome developer tools
- `--clean`: Build the typescript project from scratch

**Example:**

```bash
orion dev --clean
```

This command will:
1. Compile your TypeScript code
2. Watch for changes in your files
3. Automatically restart the server when changes are detected

### orion prod

Starts an Orionjs application as a production Node.js application.

```bash
orion prod [options]
```

## Environment Variables Integration

Orionjs CLI automatically integrates with `@orion-js/env`. To use encrypted environment variables, set these two variables:

```
ORION_ENV_FILE_PATH=./config/env.yml
ORION_ENV_SECRET_KEY=your-decryption-password
```

See the [Env documentation](/overview/other-modules/env) for details.

## Requirements

- Node.js >=14.0.0
- TypeScript

## Environment Variables

The Orionjs CLI automatically loads environment variables from a `.env` file in your project root, making it easy to configure your application for different environments.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors while using the CLI, they will be displayed with helpful error messages. Most common issues are related to missing parameters or incorrect project setup.
