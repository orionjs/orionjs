Orionjs comes with a built-in CLI tool that helps you start your application in production mode.

## Deployment Steps

The deployment process for an Orionjs application follows a standard Node.js deployment workflow:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   pnpm orion prod
   ```
   This will start the Node.js server using the entry point at `app/index.ts`.

## Environment Variables

Remember that you must set the environment variables needed to load the `.env` file before starting the server:

- `ORION_ENV_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key used to decrypt your environment variables
- `ORION_ENV_FILE_PATH`: Path to your encrypted environment file
