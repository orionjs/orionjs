# Getting Started with Orionjs

This guide will help you set up a new Orionjs project quickly by using our example repository.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm package manager
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and Node.js

## Clone the Example Project

The easiest way to get started with Orionjs is to clone or download our example project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/orionjs/orionjs.git

# Navigate to the example directory
cd orionjs/example

# Install dependencies
yarn install
# or if you're using npm
# npm install
```

## Project Structure

The example project follows the standard Orionjs structure:

```
example/
├── app/              # Main application code
│   ├── components/   # Application components
│   ├── config/       # Application configuration
│   └── index.ts      # Application entry point
├── .env.local.yml    # Environment variables
├── package.json      # Project dependencies
├── start.sh          # Start script for local development
└── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
```

For a more detailed explanation of the project structure, check out our [Project Structure](/project-structure) guide.

## Running the Application

You can start the application in development mode using:

```bash
# Using the provided start script
./start.sh

# Or manually
export ORION_ENV_SECRET_KEY=pk+uJ3wTEZxuDWKF6zdeypUzQQNkKE3i+bnfHe6g+RU=
export ORION_ENV_FILE_PATH=.env.local.yml
export PORT=3010
yarn dev
```

The application will start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3010`.

## Key Features of the Example

The example project demonstrates several key features of Orionjs:

- Component-based architecture
- HTTP controllers for REST endpoints
- GraphQL resolvers and models
- Background jobs
- Event-driven programming with Echoes
- Configuration management

## Next Steps

After exploring the example project, you might want to:

1. Create your own components following the same structure
2. Modify existing controllers to suit your needs
3. Add new resolvers for your GraphQL API
4. Set up your own database connection

- [Services](/essentials/services)
- [GraphQL](/essentials/graphql)

Happy coding with Orionjs!
