Orionjs compiles to a standard Node.js project, allowing you to deploy it to any server that can run Node.js.

## Deployment Steps

The deployment process for an Orionjs application follows a standard Node.js deployment workflow:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   yarn orion build
   ```
   This will compile the project to a standard Node.js application and place the output in the `build` folder.

3. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   node build/index.js
   ```
   This will start the Node.js server using the entry point at `build/index.js`.

## Environment Variables

Remember that you must set the environment variables needed to load the `.env` file before starting the server:

- `ORION_ENV_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key used to decrypt your environment variables
- `ORION_ENV_FILE_PATH`: Path to your encrypted environment file
